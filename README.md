The different `.cpp` files are all one single solution, each for a different problem. Because of both bad versioning and poor file management, all of the older versions are lost.

Although I found my performance to be quite satisfactory for all but one of the given problems at the time, I may return to these problems for fun to see if I can improve on these works. However, this is rather unlikely.
