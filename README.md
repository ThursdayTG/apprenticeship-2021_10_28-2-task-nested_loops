# apprenticeship-2021_10_28-task-nested_loops
These were quite a few tasks, and they really didn't mix well with my sleep deprivation that day. And then we had a very limited amount of time, as we spent a good amount of time on the previous task the same day. The only problems of these that I have solved that day are 1, 3, 4, and 5.

Also, apparently I was the only one in my entire class who had separated the different problems in different files, and I have no idea why. One guy even managed to accidentally overwrite that file when he was almost finished with solving all problems, and, because he also put everything in a single file, lost it all just like that. I'm at a loss for words ...
