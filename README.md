On a one week long break, I planned to do way more programming than just continuing to work on these tasks we were given, but oh well.
Technically there's also a folder of work that I had done at 2021-11-05, however it was pretty much only cleaning up the folder and refining the structure of the files without actually changing the functions or solutions.
